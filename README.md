# node_js
This repository contains examples of working with various aspects of Node.js, including middleware, file system handling, streams, events, and routers.

 Middleware

The `middleware-example` folder contains an example of using middleware in Node.js. This example demonstrates how to create and use middleware to handle HTTP requests.

1. Navigate to the folder with the desired example (`middleware-example`, `file-system-example`, etc.).
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run the example by executing `npm start`.e require additional dependencies other than the standard modules built into Node.js.
